## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you could add more to your mood board or improve the design.

--- task ---

You could:

+ Replace 'lorem ipsum' placeholder text with text that helps to set the mood
+ Add more images or emojis
+ Add more sections of content
+ Add really helpful image `alt` text that would help set the mood for a person using a screen reader
+ Experiment with different border, gradient, or transparency effects
+ Create a different mood board using different techniques and styles

You could also:
+ Adjust the colour palette

[[[web-colour-palette]]]

Or, you could choose an image and then select a colour palette to match.

**Notice** that `page` is typically kept white `#ffffff`, but you might decide to change it as well.

+ Check that you colour palette uses contrasting colours

Contrasting colours make the text readable for your user. You can check and adjust your colours using a [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/){:target="_blank"}.

**Tip:** If you find it difficult to find contrasting colours, black works well on light backgrounds and white works well on dark backgrounds.
