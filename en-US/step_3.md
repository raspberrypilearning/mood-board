Your mood board will have several sections of content using a combination of text, images or emoji.

Think about the sections you want to add. You could sketch your layout on paper if you prefer.

[[[wrapped-regular-width]]]

[[[three-text-tiles]]]

[[[text-image-text]]]

[[[wrapped-wide-narrow]]]

[[[full-width-quote]]]

[[[web-wrap-gap]]]
