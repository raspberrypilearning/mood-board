## Design your mood board

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
In this step you will choose a topic for your mood board and choose a matching colour palette and fonts. You will check that your colour palette has good contrast so that it is accessible.

What is the topic of your mood board? 

+ 🎉 **Party**: for a specific occasion or theme
+ 🎨 **Artwork**: Book cover, poster, flyer, comic book

+ 🌳 **Inspired by nature**: Terrarium, outside space
+ 🐠 **Inspired by animals**: Fish tank, tropical rainforest

Remember, you don't need to create a complete web page, you are just going to make a page that is visually appealing and sets a mood.

Your webpage should not contain any <span style="color: #0faeb0">**personal information**</span> that can reveal your identity and/or location. Be very careful about who you share personal information with.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Graphic designers, interior designers, industrial designers, photographers, user interface designers and other creative artists**</span> use mood boards to visually illustrate the style they wish to pursue. Amateur and professional designers alike may use them as an aid for more subjective purposes such as how they want to decorate their bedroom, or the vibe they want to convey through their fashion.

Your mood board will use a colour palette so that it looks appealing with colours that work well together.

The starter project has matching font variables that have been set up for you. You can change the fonts used in these variables if you want to use a different style.

[[[web-fonts]]]
[[[google-fonts]]]

**Test:** Check that your web page is using your new fonts if you added them.

Now that you have decided the theme for your mood board web page, and created your colours and fonts, it is a good idea to save your project. 

If you have a Trinket account, you can click on the **Remix** button to save a copy to your **My Trinkets** library.

If you don’t have a Trinket account, you can still come back to your project in the future on the same computer by using the starter project link.

You can also publish your saved mood board to see what it would look like as a full web page. Each time you save your project your published site will update:

**Tip:** To make your mood board viewable by people with disabilities and appealing to a wide audience you need to make sure it is accessible:
