## Design your mood board

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
In this step you will choose a topic for your mood board and choose a matching colour palette and fonts. You will check that your colour palette has good contrast so that it is accessible.

What is the topic of your mood board? 

+ Party: for a specific occasion or theme
+ Artwork: Book cover, poster, flyer, comic book
+ Logo or product design: 
+ Decorate a space: Classroom, makerspace, cafe
+ Fashion design: glasses frames, sari, bag
+ Inspired by nature: Terrarium, outside space
+ Inspired by animals: Fish tank, tropical rainforest 
+ Character design or world building

Remember, you don't need to create a complete web page, you are just going to make a page that is visually appealing and sets a mood.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Graphic designers, interior designers, industrial designers, photographers, user interface designers and other creative artists**</span> use mood boards to visually illustrate the style they wish to pursue. Amateur and professional designers alike may use them as an aid for more subjective purposes such as how they want to decorate their bedroom, or the vibe they want to convey through their fashion.
