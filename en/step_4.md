Add any **text** that you want to appear on your mood board. 

**Choose:** Your text could be any combination of:
+ short words or phrases that fit with your topic,
+ nonsense 'lorem ipsum' placeholder text to give the idea of what text would look like, or
+ an inspirational quote. 

Don't spend too much time on the detail of the text. A mood board just sets the mood for a project.

It is traditional to use nonsense Latin text as a placeholder on a web page so that you can see what a layout looks like.

**Choose:** Add images and/or emoji to make your page more interesting. 

The starter project includes lots of images that you could use on your mood board.

Replace 'placeholder.png' in an `<img>` tag with the name of your chosen image and change the `alt` description to match. 

--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false

<img src="placeholder.png" alt="Description of the image.">

--- /code ---

--- /collapse ---

Anywhere you have an `<img>` element you could replace it with a huge emoji:

--- collapse ---

---
title: Add a huge emoji
---

--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false
---

<p class="narrow, hugefont">
    üçÇ
</p>

--- /code ---

--- /collapse ---

**Tip:** It's fine to use the same image or emoji multiple times on your page to quickly fill your page.

**Test:** Have a look at your web page and make sure you are happy with the content.
