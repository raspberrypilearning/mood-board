## Add style

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
In this step you can add style to your mood board including font sizes and styles, centering, borders, gradients, transparency or rounded corners. You don't need to add everything! Just add the features that you need to create the effect you want.

Use the `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary` classes to control the colours of each `<section>` or `<div>`.

**Tip:** You don't have to have text in every box, you can just create a solid block of colour.

**Test:** Check that you are happy with the way your mood board looks. Don't feel that you have to use lots of different effects, sometimes less is more!
